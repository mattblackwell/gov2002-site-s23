Suppose that the probability of contraband found among non-stopped drivers is equal across both racial groups.\n(a.) What values of the probability of contraband among non-stopped drivers would imply the probability of contraband among whites is higher than contraband among non-whites in general?\n(b.) Suppose you are asked to find whether there is (and if there is, how much) racial bias in who is stopped by the police. You use the following measure to quantify racial discrimination: \\(P(S|C,W^c) - P(S|C,W)\\). The reasoning for this measure is as follows: if there is no racial bias in police stops, we might expect that \\(S \\perp W \\ | \\ C\\). This would mean given that if the driver is actually carrying contraband, their race should not update the probability of a police choosing to stop them. To show that this false – that race update the probability of a stop – we need to simply show that this measure is equal to zero. In English, it can be interpreted as, ``the increase in probability of getting stopped if a contraband carrier is not white’’.\nAssuming that the rates of contraband in the population are independent of race, plot and interpret possible bounds for this measure using the information provided in this problem. Hint: use Bayes’ Rule and compute the bounds using R. Hint part 2: let \\(x = P(C|W^c,S^c) = P(C|W, S^c)\\)."

Since \\(X\\) does not follow a standard probability distribution e.g. a normal, exponential, or uniform distribution, there is no function built in to R to generate random samples from it like rnorm(), rexp(), or runif(). Fortunately, we can generate samples from any probability distribution for which there is a closed-form CDF using what is called “inversion sampling” or “inverse transform sampling.”\nTo do this, we take advantage of two things: 1) the fact that all computing languages can generate pseudo-random numbers from the uniform distribution over the interval [0, 1] and 2) the fact that the CDF of \\(X\\) (and other random variables generally) is a function that maps the support of \\(X\\) to probabilities between zero and one.\n\nFirst, find the inverse of CDF \\(F_X\\) which you found in Question 1. This function, denoted \\(F_X^{-1}\\) or \\(Q\\), is called the quantile function. The quantile function of a random variable specifies the value of a random variable such that the probability of the variable being less than or equal to that value equals the given quantile.\nGenerate 10,000 draws from a standard uniform distribution. These values can be thought of as probabilities. Plug these values into the function \\(Q\\) that you just derived.

Be sure to set your seed: set.seed(02138).\n\nSuppose that Bob has correctly predicted six of the last eight election outcomes. What is the probability that someone randomly flipping a coin each of the same elections would have experienced the same success as Bob? Use R to compute your answer analytically (i.e. not by simulation).\n\nForecasting has become so popular that riffraff are flooding the market. These “uniform amateurs” predict the vote share for each state in the U.S. presidential election by drawing a uniform random variable between 0 and 1, independently across states. You are deciding whether or not to hire a forecaster, Nate, to to forecast each of the 50 state election winners in the 2024 presidential general election based on the performance of his 2020 election forecast, but you are worried that Nate might be one of these amateurs. When you ask him to justify his 2020 forecasts, he says “my highest predicted [Democratic] vote share was 0.8 which is very unlikely if I were a uniform amateur.” Let’s evaluate his claim.\n\nSuppose Nate is a uniform amateur and let \\(X\\) be the maximum of the 51 uniform vote share draws (include D.C.). Derive the CDF and PDF of \\(X\\). Use these to calculate the probability of Nate’s highest Democratic vote share being 0.8 or less if he were a uniform amateur.\nTo be on the lookout for more uniform amateurs, it’s helpful to know what highest vote share we should expect. To that end, calculate \\(E[X]\\)."

    "text": "Question 5 (15 points)\nThe circus owner is planning to ship his 50 elephants and so he needs a rough estimate of the total weight of the elephants. As weighing an elephant is a cumbersome process, the owner wants to estimate the total weight by weighing just one elephant. Which elephant should he weigh? So the owner looks back on his records and discovers a list of the elephants’ weights taken 3 years ago. He finds that 3 years ago, Sambo, the middle-sized elephant was the average (in weight) elephant in the herd. he checks with the elephant trainer who reassures him (the owner) that Sambo may still be considered to be the average elephant in the herd. Therefore, the owner plans to weigh Sambo and take \\(50y\\) (where \\(y\\) is the present weight of Sambo) as an estimate of the total weight \\(Y =Y_1+Y_2+...+Y_{50}\\) of the 50 elephants. But the circus statistician is horrified when he learns of the owner’s purposive sampling plan. ‘How can you get an unbiased estimate of Y this way?’ protests the statistician. So, together they work out a compromise sampling plan. With the help of a table of random numbers they devise a plan that allots a selection probability of 99/100 to Sambo, and equal selection probabilities to each of the other 49 elephants. Naturally, Sambo is selected and the owner is happy. ‘How are you going to estimate \\(Y\\)?’ asks the statistician. ‘Why? The estimate ought to be \\(50y\\) of course,’ says the owner. ‘Oh! No! That cannot possibly be right,’ says the statistician, ‘I recently read an article in the where it is proved that the Horvitz-Thompson estimator is the unique hyperadmissible estimator in the class of all generalized polynomial unbiased estimators.’ ‘What is the Horvitz-Thompson estimate in this case?’ asks the owner, duly impressed. ‘Since the selection probability of Sambo in our plan was 99/100,’ says the statistician, ‘the proper estimate of \\(Y\\) is (i)___ and not \\(50y\\).’ ‘And, how would you have estimated \\(Y\\),’ inquires the incredulous owner, ‘if our sampling plan made us select, say the big elephant Jumbo?’ ‘According to what I understand of the Horvitz-Thompson estimation method,’ say the unhappy statistician, ‘the proper estimate of Y would then have been (ii)___ , where \\(y\\) is Jumbo’s weight.’ That is how the statistician lost his circus job (and perhaps became a teacher of statistics!).”\n\nShow that the Horvitz-Thompson estimator for a finite population is unbiased: \\(\\widehat{Y}_{H T}= \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{I_{i} y_{i}}{\\pi_{i}} = Y\\)\nFill in the blanks in (i) and (ii).

    "text": "Question 1 (20 points)\nThis problem will use the subprime data to walk you through a very common inference problem - testing whether the difference between two population values is non-zero. To begin this problem first download subprime.csv and load it into R.\nWe are going to be interested primarily in the loan.amount variable - the amount that each loan recipient received. Suppose a lawsuit has been filed in U.S. District Court by a group of Fort Myers women who claim that women in the area were loaned less money than men. The defendants – a group of local mortgage lenders – are vigorously denying these claims, and the case is now advancing to trial. Having heard about your expertise in this area, the federal judge hearing the case has brought you in to provide expert testimony. Your task in this problem is to assist the judge in her determination.\n\nSuppose you were only able to interview \\(100\\) male and \\(100\\) female loan recipients at random, making them iid. To simulate this in R, set the seed to 02138 and draw \\(100\\) observations randomly from the male subset of the subprime data and \\(100\\) observations randomly from the female subset of the data. These \\(200\\) observations constitute your sample. Calculate (1) the average loan amount (loan.amount) for women in your sample, (2) the average loan amount for men, and (3) and (4), the sample standard deviation for each. Report those results in a nicely formatted table.\nLet \\(\\mu_{m}\\) and \\(\\mu_{w}\\) be the population average loan amount for men and women respectively. Let \\(\\sigma^2_{m}\\) and \\(\\sigma^2_{w}\\) be the population variances in loan amount for men and women respectively. Denote the sample average loan amounts for men by \\(\\bar{X}_{m}\\) and for women by \\(\\bar{X}_{w}\\). What is the expected value of the sampling distribution of \\(\\bar{X}_{m} - \\bar{X}_{w}\\)? What is the variance of the sampling distribution of \\(\\bar{X}_{m} - \\bar{X}_{w}\\)?\nCompute and report your sample difference in average loan amount for men and women. Recall that for large samples, the sampling distribution of a mean or difference-in-means is approximately normal. Suppose that we know that the true population \\(\\sigma^2_{m} = 32381.57\\) and \\(\\sigma^2_{w} = 19097.95\\). Using the normal approximation, what is the probability that we would observe a difference-in-means at least as extreme as the one in our sample if the true population difference-in-means \\(\\mu_{m} - \\mu_{w}\\) equals 0? Note that by “at least as extreme,” we mean a value that is further away from \\(0\\) than the value we observe - that is, \\(P(|\\bar{X}_{m} - \\bar{X}_{w}| \\ge \\alpha)\\) where \\(\\alpha\\) is our observed value and \\(||\\) is the absolute value operator.\nHint: In R you can get the probability that a normally distributed random variable takes on a value less than or equal to some value q using the command pnorm(q, mean, sd) where mean is the mean of the normal distribution and sd is the standard deviation.\nComment on your result in (c). Given what we observe in our sample, is it likely that there is no difference in loan amounts for men and women? A common threshold for “rejecting” our assumed hypothesis that \\(\\mu_{m} - \\mu_{w} = 0\\) is observing a sample that would occur with probability \\(.05\\) or less if that hypothesis were true (that is, a very unlikely sample). Would we reject the hypothesis that there is no difference in average loan amounts between men and women?"

    "text": "Question 3 (20 points)\nIn the case Hazelwood School District v. United States (1977), which went to the Supreme Court, the United States argued that the Hazelwood School District in Missouri was practicing racial discrimination in their hiring of teachers. Data were presented showing that only 15 out of \\(405(3.7 \\%)\\) of the teachers hired by the school district were black.\n\nIn the original case, the District Court ruled in favor of the school district, saying “The number of black teachers employed by the Hazelwood district is undeniably meager. Nonetheless, it has kept pace with the small but steadily increasing black enrollment in the district. For the 1970-71 school year the six black teachers hired by the Hazelwood district comprised less than one percent of its total faculty. However, the number of black students enrolled during that period was likewise only one percent of the total district attendance.” The United States appealed this decision, arguing that the relevant population for comparison was the teachers in St. Louis County and St. Louis City, not the students in the Hazelwood district. (St. Louis City borders but is not included in St. Louis County, since the city seceded from the county in 1876.) About \\(15.4 \\%\\) of the teachers in this population were black, which intuitively seems like a massive disparity compared with the \\(3.7 \\%\\) statistic in the Hazelwood district. The Appeals Court ruled in favor of the United States. The school district then appealed the Appeals Court decision to the Supreme Court, arguing that St. Louis City should be excluded from the population for comparison, due to the city having very different hiring guidelines than were present in the county. Discuss the principles and considerations you would use in deciding on the population to compare the Hazelwood district statistic with. (You do not need to resolve the question of whether teachers in St. Louis City should be included in the comparison population.)\nThe Supreme Court ruled that the comparison should be with St. Louis County, excluding St. Louis City. In St. Louis County, \\(5.7 \\%\\) of teachers were black. Suppose that, before observing the data for Hazelwood district, we know that \\(n=405\\) teachers will be hired and that \\(X \\sim \\operatorname{Bin}(n, p)\\) of these teachers are black. What would you use as your null and alternative hypotheses if you would like to show that Hazelwood district discriminates against black teachers in their hiring process? Conduct this test, and find the p-value. (We are just looking at disparities in hiring; of course in reality there are many complications such as who applies for which jobs, how people are recruited, what salaries are offered, etc.)\nRepeat (b), except with a Normal approximation to the Binomial\nThe majority opinion stated that “the expected value of 23 would be less than two standard deviations from the observed total of \\(15^{\\prime \\prime}\\). Is this correct? The Supreme Court concluded that the null hypothesis of no discrimination could not be rejected (presumably setting \\(\\alpha=0.05\\) and mentioning”two standard deviations” since \\(1.96 \\approx 2\\) ). In a dissenting opinion, Justice Stevens stated that “one of my law clerks advised me that, given the size of the two-year sample, there is only about a \\(5 \\%\\) likelihood that a disparity this large would be produced by a random selection from the labor pool.” Was Justice Stevens’s clerk correct? How can the discrepancy between the majority opinion failing to reject the null and Justice Stevens rejecting the null be reconciled?"

    "text": "Question 4: Regression Analysis of Subprime Loans\nThis problem will guide you through thinking about the conditional expectation function and how it relates to regression and how we can connect it back to hypothesis testing.\nFor this problem, we are going to use the subprime data. Recall that these are data collected by the U.S. government on all home lending transactions in Cape Coral and Fort Myers. They contain information on each loan applicant and give information on whether that applicant received a subprime loan (high.rate) as well as on the amount of the loan (loan.amount). They also contain basic demographic information such as race, gender, and income.\nAssume the data represent the “truth” (i.e., an entire population). Also assume that the data in this population are distributed i.i.d. Take a sample of size 250, without replacement, from this population. Set your seed to 02138 before doing so. You will be working with this sample throughout this problem.\n\n(a)\nYou care about the relationship between the variables income and loan.amount – seems like there should be a relationship between those two, right?\nAs per usual, you have a friend (you really need to get some new friends) who proposes that you use the following strategy to see if there is a relationship: Create a new income income.bin variable that takes on four values using the cut() function in R:\n\na value for if income falls into the [0, 25] percentile range (which you can find via quantile()),\na value if it falls into the (25, 50] range,\na value for the (50, 75] range, and a value for the (75, 100] range.\n\nNote that the lower bounds are NOT inclusive, except for the first range.\nRun a regression of loan.amount on income.bin, and report the coefficients, standard errors, \\(R^2\\) and sample size in a nicely formatted table (recall section).\n\n\n(b)\nLet’s compare the approach in (a) to using a regression on the original continuous variable. What is an assumption we make in the approach in (a) that we don’t make when we run a regression? We are looking for an assumption related to the fact that you have taken a continuous variable and stratified it into four categories.\n\n\n(c)\nBased on the results of the regression on binned income in (a), do you think the linearity assumption needed for a bivariate regression on the original continuous variable holds in this case? Why or why not?\n\n\n(d)\nIn spite of your friend’s opinion, you decide to run a regression of loan.amount on income. Run this regression within your sample, and report the coefficients, standard errors, \\(R^2\\) and sample size in a nicely formatted table (recall section).\n\n\n(e)\nInterpret the estimated coefficients.

    "text": "Question 1 (30 points)\nOften our data is collected with error, which we refer to as measurement error. For instance, for a dependent variable Y you’re trying to measure in a survey, respondents may randomly mis-click, or they may systematically lie about having a socially undesirable trait. In this question, we will explore the impact of measurement error in regression analysis in the most favourable case where the measurement error is independent of the true values. Consider the linear projection:\n\\[\nL[Y \\mid 1, X] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X\n\\]\nwith the projection error denoted as \\(e = Y - L[Y \\mid 1, X]\\), and \\(\\mathbb{V}[X] = \\sigma_X^2\\). Unfortunately, we do not observe \\(Y\\) or \\(X\\) but instead noisy proxies for them \\(\\{\\tilde{Y}, \\tilde{X}\\}\\), where\n\\[\n\\tilde{Y} = Y + v, \\quad \\tilde{X} = X + w\n\\]\nWhere \\(v\\) is one realization from \\(V \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(0, \\sigma_{v}^{2}\\right)\\) and \\(w\\) is one realization from \\(W \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(0, \\sigma_{w}^{2}\\right)\\), where \\(W\\) and \\(V\\) are independent of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\).

To begin, load CEO.csv from Ed. The data came from a survey of 632 Americans. They were asked questions on how much they thought CEOs do and should earn.

Identify the unit in the data with the largest leverage or hat value and describe where on the scatterplot that unit is. Calculate the change in the estimated slope from dropping that unit (you can either run another regression or use the closed-form expression given in lecture).\nWe are going to walk through ways to check our regression assumptions. A common way of checking for non-linearity is to examine a plot in which the fitted values from a regression are plotted on the x-axis and the residuals from the regression are plotted on the y-axis (often called a ). We can get the fitted values from a regression using the \\(\\texttt{fitted()}\\) function and the residuals using the \\(\\texttt{residuals()}\\) function. Intuitively, if linearity holds we would expect the residuals to be positive and negative in equal proportions at all points along the regression line. By plotting the residuals against the fitted values, we can see whether there are regions of the regression line where the residuals tend to be systematically positive or negative. Create a plot like this and interpret it. Based on this method, does there seem to be substantial non-linearity? If so, how would you correct it?\nNow we are going to introduce a second regressor.

Doing that pattern matching takes some experience, but it’s often help to try and strip a problem of its extraneous detail and focus on what the core elements are.

    "text": "Description\nQuantitative methods in the social sciences are exploding. Each year researchers are deploying new and exciting methods to answer important substantive questions. But to use (and not misuse) these novel methods, it is crucial to have a firm understanding of the basic building blocks of quantitative methods in the social sciences: probability, statistical inference, and (more often than not) the linear model. This course, the second in the four-course quantitative methods sequence for PhD students in the Government department, provides this rigorous foundation necessary for the rest of the sequence and the rest of your careers. After reviewing the basic probability and statistical inference, we offer a systematic introduction to the linear model and its variants – the workhorse models for social scientists. We will cover the material with enough mathematical rigor to understand the intuition and concepts, but also cover how to use statistical computing to apply the methods."

We will also assume some familiarity with calculus and linear algebra at the level of the Gov Math Prefresher. Because we’ll be using more linear algebra than in 2001, we have also set up a mostly self-guided Gov January Linear Algebra Review for students to complete ahead of the course to get up to speed with those concepts. We assume basic familiarity with R, Rmarkdown, and LaTeX.\nNo matter your background, you should be prepared to engage the class material on a regular, almost daily basis even beyond the time dedicated to assignments and exam review. This material can be challenging for many students (it was for me!)."

    "text": "Problem Sets\nMethods are tools and it isn’t very instructive to read a lot about hammers or watch someone else wield a hammer. You need to get your hands on a hammer or two. Thus, in this course, you will have problem sets on a (roughly) weekly basis. They will be a mix of analytic problems, computer simulations, and data analysis.\nGiven the (waves hands generically at the world) situation, we understand that circumstances might make things difficult this semester. Accordingly, we will be dropping your lowest two problem set scores.\nThe schedule for the problem sets will be:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem Set\nRelease Date\nDue Date\n\n\n\n\nProblem Set 1\nThu, Jan 26th 12:00pm ET\nWed, Feb 1st 11:59pm ET\n\n\nProblem Set 2\nThu, Feb 2nd 12:00pm ET\nWed, Feb 8th 11:59pm ET\n\n\nProblem Set 3\nThu, Feb 9th 12:00pm ET\nWed, Feb 15th 11:59pm ET\n\n\nProblem Set 4\nThu, Feb 16th 12:00pm ET\nWed, Feb 20th 11:59pm ET\n\n\nProblem Set 5\nThu, Mar 9th 12:00pm ET\nWed, Mar 22nd 11:59pm ET\n\n\nProblem Set 6\nThu, Mar 23nd 12:00pm ET\nWed, Mar 29th 11:59pm ET\n\n\nProblem Set 7\nThu, Mar 30th 12:00pm ET\nWed, Apr 5th 11:59pm ET\n\n\nProblem Set 8\nThu, Apr 6th 12:00pm ET\nWed, Apr 12th 11:59pm ET\n\n\nProblem Set 9\nThu, Apr 13th 12:00pm ET\nWed, Apr 19th 11:59pm ET\n\n\nProblem Set 10\nThu, Apr 20th 12:00pm ET\nWed, Apr 26th 11:59pm ET\n\n\n\n\nLate policy\nThe late policy for problem sets will be a 10% percentage point penalty per 24 hour period late up to 48 hours. After that point, we will need to release solutions for the problem sets and will not be able to accept any more late work. No late work will be accepted for exams."

Given the stress and potential for technological problems, however, you will have 3 hours to complete it. Since there a wide distribution of availability and time zones in the class, we will make the exam available to checkout over a 36-hour window on Canvas. Once you check out the exam, you will have 3 hours to complete it. There is no discussion or collaboration with other students or humans permitted on the midterm exam. The exam is tentatively scheduled for the sixth week of term (probably March 2-3)."

You can sign up for the Gov 2002 Ed page by clicking the Ed Discussion link on the sidebar of the Canvas page and you can join the Gov 2002 Slack here. To become more familiar with the platforms, please see the Ed users guide and the Slack quick start.\nWith two platforms, you might ask: where do I post what? In Gov 2002, Ed will be for help with and discussion of the content and materials of the course, whereas Slack will be for organization and community. Thus, questions and discussions about problem sets, reading, lectures, section, and so on would go on Ed. Slack would be better suited for meeting people, organizing study groups, seeing announcements about class, and various other logistical/social conversations.\nWhen discussing problem sets on Ed, please refrain from posting large portions of your solutions to a question. If, for some reason, you feel you need to post such a excerpt from your solutions to ask your question, you may make the question private (which means only the course staff can view it). Please use this sparingly, since more questions (and answers!) helps the whole group. In addition, please search before posting a question to see if someone else has already posted. Use the categories to help organize the discussions for others to read."

This is almost always the fastest way to get an answer. However, you can also email me directly at mblackwell@gov.harvard.edu. If the question is of general interest, I will forward the question and my answer to the class. Make sure to tell me explicitly in your email if you would like to stay anonymous."

For beginners, there are several web-based tutorials. In these, you will be able to learn the basic syntax of R. We’ll post more R resources on the course website.\nWe will also use git and Github to manage our projects, and a combination of LaTeX and Rmarkdown to typeset the problem sets."

    "text": "Academic Honesty\nThe work that you do in both the problem sets should be your own work. You may seek help from others so long as this does not result in someone else completing your work for you. When asking for help, you may show others your code to help diagnose a bug or highlight a potential issue, but you should not view their (working) code. You should cite any discussions you have with other students in your problem set and note if they helped you with your code. You should never copy and paste code from another student or elsewhere (e.g., websites, former students).\nI also strongly suggest that you make a solo effort at all the problems before consulting others. The exams will be very difficult if you have no experience working on your own. There is no collaboration allowed on the exams."
