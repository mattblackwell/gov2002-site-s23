    "text": "Problem set tips\nWhen completing a problem set, avoid writing a series of mathematical statements without prose. You should explain each step in any derivation so that both you and the grader can understand what you are doing. This is useful since (a) it helps reinforce the concept for your own understanding, (b) conveys to the grader (and eventually the world) that you understand the concepts that you are using, and (c) helps the grader debug any potential problems with the derivation to provide the highest quality feedback.\nWhen working with mathematical probability and statistics, success usually comes from pattern matching: this problem is isomorphic to some other problem that we’ve done before. Doing that pattern matching takes some experience, but it’s often help to try and strip a problem of its extraneous detail and focus on what the core elements are. Then, if you can’t see the path forward, try to find a problem that we (or the textbooks) have solved that has the same core elements."

    "text": "Description\nQuantitative methods in the social sciences are exploding. Each year researchers are deploying new and exciting methods to answer important substantive questions. But to use (and not misuse) these novel methods, it is crucial to have a firm understanding of the basic building blocks of quantitative methods in the social sciences: probability, statistical inference, and (more often than not) the linear model. This course, the second in the four-course quantitative methods sequence for PhD students in the Government department, provides this rigorous foundation necessary for the rest of the sequence and the rest of your careers. After reviewing the basic probability and statistical inference, we offer a systematic introduction to the linear model and its variants – the workhorse models for social scientists. We will cover the material with enough mathematical rigor to understand the intuition and concepts, but also cover how to use statistical computing to apply the methods."

In Gov 2002, Ed will be for help with and discussion of the content and materials of the course, whereas Slack will be for organization and community. Thus, questions and discussions about problem sets, reading, lectures, section, and so on would go on Ed. Slack would be better suited for meeting people, organizing study groups, seeing announcements about class, and various other logistical/social conversations.\nWhen discussing problem sets on Ed, please refrain from posting large portions of your solutions to a question. If, for some reason, you feel you need to post such a excerpt from your solutions to ask your question, you may make the question private (which means only the course staff can view it). Please use this sparingly, since more questions (and answers!) helps the whole group. In addition, please search before posting a question to see if someone else has already posted.

    "text": "Computing\nWe’ll use R in this class for computing and data analysis. R is free, open source, and available on all major platforms (including Solaris, so no excuses). RStudio (also free) is a graphical interface to R that is widely used to work with the R language. You can find a virtually endless set of resources for R and RStudio on the internet. For beginners, there are several web-based tutorials. In these, you will be able to learn the basic syntax of R. We’ll post more R resources on the course website.\nWe will also use git and Github to manage our projects, and a combination of LaTeX and Rmarkdown to typeset the problem sets."

    "text": "Mental Health\nGrad school is a stressful time in one’s life and mixing it with a global pandemic, remote learning, and dislocation makes this one of the most fraught years any of us have probably faced. We acknowledge that nothing is quite normal and that there may be times when you feel overwhelmed by this course or by life more generally. Please feel free to reach out to any of the course staff if you want to talk about any issues you are having with the course or anything else. We will always try to help and we are committed to being extra accommodating this semester on course policy issues. Please just get in touch.\nOf course, there are other resources at Harvard if you need them. A few are listed below:\n\nCounseling and Mental Health Services"

    "text": "Academic Honesty\nThe work that you do in both the problem sets should be your own work. You may seek help from others so long as this does not result in someone else completing your work for you. When asking for help, you may show others your code to help diagnose a bug or highlight a potential issue, but you should not view their (working) code. You should cite any discussions you have with other students in your problem set and note if they helped you with your code. You should never copy and paste code from another student or elsewhere (e.g., websites, former students).\nI also strongly suggest that you make a solo effort at all the problems before consulting others. The exams will be very difficult if you have no experience working on your own. There is no collaboration allowed on the exams."
