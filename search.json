The officials can take one of three actions: respond and agree to meet with you with probability 1/3, respond and reject your request with probability 1/3, or ignore your email with probability 1/3. The officials make their decisions independent of each other. Suppose you keep sending out emails until you get one official to agree to meet with you. Find the PMF of the number of emails you send out.\nNow suppose you care about whether an official has responded or not, regardless of the response. What is the PMF of the number of emails you have to send out until there’s at least one official who responds to you and one official who doesn’t? For example, the first five officials might accept, reject, reject, reject, and ghost you, after which you would stop since you have at least one response and non-response. You might also see the sequence ghost, ghost, ghost, ghost, then reject, after which you stop."

Of white drivers who are stopped by police, \\(25\\%\\) have illegal contraband, while \\(28\\%\\) of stopped non-white drivers have illegal contraband.\nLet \\(C\\) be the event of a driver possessing contraband, \\(W\\) be the event of the driver being white, and \\(S\\) being the event of the driver getting stopped by the police. Suppose that the probability of contraband found among non-stopped drivers is equal across both racial groups.\n(a.) What values of the probability of contraband among non-stopped drivers would imply the probability of contraband among whites is higher than contraband among non-whites in general?\n(b.) Suppose you are asked to find whether there is (and if there is, how much) racial bias in who is stopped by the police. You use the following measure to quantify racial discrimination: \\(P(S|C,W^c) - P(S|C,W)\\). The reasoning for this measure is as follows: if there is no racial bias in police stops, we might expect that \\(S \\perp W \\ | \\ C\\). This would mean given that if the driver is actually carrying contraband, their race should not update the probability of a police choosing to stop them. To show that this false – that race update the probability of a stop – we need to simply show that this measure is equal to zero. In English, it can be interpreted as, ``the increase in probability of getting stopped if a contraband carrier is not white’’.\nAssuming that the rates of contraband in the population are independent of race, plot and interpret possible bounds for this measure using the information provided in this problem. Hint: use Bayes’ Rule and compute the bounds using R. Hint part 2: let \\(x = P(C|W^c,S^c) = P(C|W, S^c)\\)."

    "text": "Problem set tips\nWhen completing a problem set, avoid writing a series of mathematical statements without prose. You should explain each step in any derivation so that both you and the grader can understand what you are doing. This is useful since (a) it helps reinforce the concept for your own understanding, (b) conveys to the grader (and eventually the world) that you understand the concepts that you are using, and (c) helps the grader debug any potential problems with the derivation to provide the highest quality feedback.\nWhen working with mathematical probability and statistics, success usually comes from pattern matching: this problem is isomorphic to some other problem that we’ve done before. Doing that pattern matching takes some experience, but it’s often help to try and strip a problem of its extraneous detail and focus on what the core elements are. Then, if you can’t see the path forward, try to find a problem that we (or the textbooks) have solved that has the same core elements."

    "text": "Description\nQuantitative methods in the social sciences are exploding. Each year researchers are deploying new and exciting methods to answer important substantive questions. But to use (and not misuse) these novel methods, it is crucial to have a firm understanding of the basic building blocks of quantitative methods in the social sciences: probability, statistical inference, and (more often than not) the linear model. This course, the second in the four-course quantitative methods sequence for PhD students in the Government department, provides this rigorous foundation necessary for the rest of the sequence and the rest of your careers. After reviewing the basic probability and statistical inference, we offer a systematic introduction to the linear model and its variants – the workhorse models for social scientists. We will cover the material with enough mathematical rigor to understand the intuition and concepts, but also cover how to use statistical computing to apply the methods."

We assume basic familiarity with R, Rmarkdown, and LaTeX.\nNo matter your background, you should be prepared to engage the class material on a regular, almost daily basis even beyond the time dedicated to assignments and exam review.

Thus, in this course, you will have problem sets on a (roughly) weekly basis. They will be a mix of analytic problems, computer simulations, and data analysis.\nGiven the (waves hands generically at the world) situation, we understand that circumstances might make things difficult this semester. Accordingly, we will be dropping your lowest two problem set scores.\nThe schedule for the problem sets will be:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem Set\nRelease Date\nDue Date\n\n\n\n\nProblem Set 1\nThu, Jan 26th 12:00pm ET\nWed, Feb 1st 11:59pm ET\n\n\nProblem Set 2\nThu, Feb 2nd 12:00pm ET\nWed, Feb 8th 11:59pm ET\n\n\nProblem Set 3\nThu, Feb 9th 12:00pm ET\nWed, Feb 15th 11:59pm ET\n\n\nProblem Set 4\nThu, Feb 16th 12:00pm ET\nWed, Feb 20th 11:59pm ET\n\n\nProblem Set 5\nThu, Mar 9th 12:00pm ET\nWed, Mar 22nd 11:59pm ET\n\n\nProblem Set 6\nThu, Mar 23nd 12:00pm ET\nWed, Mar 29th 11:59pm ET\n\n\nProblem Set 7\nThu, Mar 30th 12:00pm ET\nWed, Apr 5th 11:59pm ET\n\n\nProblem Set 8\nThu, Apr 6th 12:00pm ET\nWed, Apr 12th 11:59pm ET\n\n\nProblem Set 9\nThu, Apr 13th 12:00pm ET\nWed, Apr 19th 11:59pm ET\n\n\nProblem Set 10\nThu, Apr 20th 12:00pm ET\nWed, Apr 26th 11:59pm ET\n\n\n\n\nLate policy\nThe late policy for problem sets will be a 10% percentage point penalty per 24 hour period late up to 48 hours.

To become more familiar with the platforms, please see the Ed users guide and the Slack quick start.\nWith two platforms, you might ask: where do I post what? In Gov 2002, Ed will be for help with and discussion of the content and materials of the course, whereas Slack will be for organization and community. Thus, questions and discussions about problem sets, reading, lectures, section, and so on would go on Ed. Slack would be better suited for meeting people, organizing study groups, seeing announcements about class, and various other logistical/social conversations.\nWhen discussing problem sets on Ed, please refrain from posting large portions of your solutions to a question. If, for some reason, you feel you need to post such a excerpt from your solutions to ask your question, you may make the question private (which means only the course staff can view it). Please use this sparingly, since more questions (and answers!) helps the whole group. In addition, please search before posting a question to see if someone else has already posted. Use the categories to help organize the discussions for others to read."

You may seek help from others so long as this does not result in someone else completing your work for you. When asking for help, you may show others your code to help diagnose a bug or highlight a potential issue, but you should not view their (working) code. You should cite any discussions you have with other students in your problem set and note if they helped you with your code. You should never copy and paste code from another student or elsewhere (e.g., websites, former students).\nI also strongly suggest that you make a solo effort at all the problems before consulting others. The exams will be very difficult if you have no experience working on your own. There is no collaboration allowed on the exams."
